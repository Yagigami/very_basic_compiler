# very_basic_compiler
a *very* basic compiler, written in the ugliest way possible

this project was a way for me to learn how to get stuff done.
i of course plan to make a more complex language and compiler later on
the challenge was just to not give up
even if the codegen is not optimized a single bit, i am currently happy with the results
